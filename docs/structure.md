# 🧠 GhostOps: Philosophy & Suite Structure

## 🔧 Operational Philosophy

GhostOps is a modular, multi-tasking diagnostics suite for Linux — designed not as a script, but as a cockpit.  
Every module is built for forensic-grade operators who demand clarity, stealth, and reproducibility.

### Core Principles

- **Modularity**: Each function is a standalone plugin, callable via `ghostops.sh` with dynamic threading and API logic.
- **Rollback Safety**: All operations are snapshot-aware, reversible, and logged with timestamped headers.
- **Forensic Traceability**: Every action leaves an audit trail — versioned, documented, and reproducible.
- **Dynamic Adaptability**: Interfaces, templates, and plugins adapt to context — whether Wi-Fi, PAN, VPN, or tethered.
- **Cryptographic Wrappers**: Custom envelope headers ensure secure diagnostics and stealth containment.
- **Cockpit Mentality**: GhostOps is a control suite. Every trigger is intentional, every module is logged, and every workflow is future-proofed.
